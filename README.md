###How to organize a self-paced coding study group
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is probably the easiest type of coding meetup to organize. It's very simple to get started and it's also ok if the organizers themselves are just beginning coders.

This format is also very friendly to drop in attendees who are unable to join every week or to people who need to drop out from the group for a time due to other commitments but want to rejoin at any point in the future without feeling too left behind.

######Getting Started:
1. Pick a focus language or topic.
EG: JavaScript
2.	Make a list of any prerequisites.
EG: To get started with JavaScript you only need a laptop with a web browser and optionally a simple text or code editor.
3.	Gather a few links to tutorial sites. (to help new members get started)
EG: JavaScript tutorial sites: CodeCademy.com, EloquentJavaScript.net;
   practice problems: CoderByte.com, ProjectEuler.net
4.	Organize a meeting location with wifi access.

######General Format:
* 10 - 30 minutes: Short presentation on related topic (optional)
* remaining time: Independent study

We recommend meeting once a week.

You can recruit outside speakers to give short presentations related to your group's focus topic and also encourage members themselves to present something new they've learned or share projects they are working on. Try to vary the level of talks from beginner to more intermediate or advanced. Keep the presentation short and informal however so the focus of the group is on self-paced study time.

During study time, encourage members to speak up and help each other if they get stuck. Allow members to study as they wish using the materials of their choice or to work on personal projects. Members can either study independently or form small groups to work together as they prefer.
