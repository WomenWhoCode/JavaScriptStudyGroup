#HOWTO: JavaScript Study Group 
====================

#####How to organize a self-paced coding study group

This study group is a fun and simple event that allows for varying experience levels.

The format is also very friendly to drop in attendees who are unable to join every week or to people who need to drop out from the group for a time due to other commitments but want to rejoin at any point in the future without feeling too left behind.

We recommend meeting once a week.

######General Format:
* 10 - 30 minutes: Short presentation on related topic (optional)
* remaining time: Independent study



######Lightning talks

You can recruit outside speakers to give short presentations related to your group's focus topic and also encourage members themselves to present something new they've learned or share projects they are working on. Try to vary the level of talks from beginner to more intermediate or advanced. Keep the presentation short and informal however so the focus of the group is on self-paced study time.


######Open Study/Hacking

During study time, encourage members to speak up and help each other if they get stuck. Allow members to study as they wish using the materials of their choice or to work on personal projects. Members can either study independently or form small groups to work together as they prefer.
